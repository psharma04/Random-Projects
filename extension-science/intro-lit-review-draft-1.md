## Significance of the Research

Alzheimer’s disease (henceforth referred to as “AD”) is a neurodegenerative disease which is responsible for over 60% of dementia cases in the developed world. From 2000 to 2013, every major fatal disease group (cancers, cardiovascular diseases, viral infections, etc.) experienced a significant decline in case numbers throughout the United States and Canada, with the sole exception of neurodegenerative diseases which, in the case of AD, experienced a 71% increase in case numbers over the 13 year span (Alzheimer’s Association 2016). AD has become an epidemic, and at a time where human life expectancies have nearly doubled from 100 years ago, it has become critical to maintain the quality of life for an ever-growing population of potential victims. As AD is the primary cause of Years of Life Lost for individuals above 60 in developed nations (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 2021), research into causes and potential treatments is a critical step in eliminating the harms caused by neurodegenerative diseases.

## Background (Literature Review)

Alzheimer’s research in the past 2 decades has primarily focused on the “Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis”, which considers the buildup of Amyloid Beta plaques as responsible for the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. 

The development and history of this line of inquiry has been explored by Tanzi and Bertram (2005), including the identification of the links between Down Syndrome and Alzheimer’s. The paper explores other investigations into the “Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis”, identifying developments in Alzheimer’s research from 1985 to 2005, as well as areas of potential future investigation, such as the impact of bioinformatics and its implications for neurodegenerative disease research. This paper is significant as it produces a direct explanation for the onset of AD, as well as opening a new area of research for mitigation and treatment.

Individuals with Down Syndrome have a 50% chance of developing Alzheimer’s before the age of 50, as explored by Handen (2020), who postulates that this increased risk can be attributed to certain genes on chromosome 21 (the duplication of which is responsible for Down Syndrome to begin with). Their paper discusses the implications and results of the Alzheimer’s Biomarker Consortium for Down Syndrome, a government funded, multi-institutional study which evaluated over 400 DS-affected individuals for signs of Alzheimer’s onset. Their results closely aligned with the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis, identifying the APP gene (Amyloid Precursor Protein) on chromosome 21 as highly differentially expressed in DS patients with Alzheimer’s but weakly expressed in DS patients without Alzheimer’s. This study aligns with not only Tanzi and Bertram, but also the widely accepted explanation for the disease.

Aligning with this theory is Jiang, Qian and Shengdi’s paper on Oxidative stress as a cause of Alzheimer’s (2016), which identified that the buildup of Amyloid-Beta and Tau proteins was “tightly associated with the neural damage” caused by AD, affecting signalling pathways such as Protein Kinase B and other extracellular protein Kinases. Results were found by analysing subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (primarily the quantity of free radicals in the form of reactive oxygen species), and observing the effects of oxidative damage to the lipids, proteins, and DNA in the central nervous system. While the paper did not identify the method by which the protein plaques affected neural pathways, it confirmed the damage vector of Amyloid plaques, allowing for investigations into future treatment methods.

While the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis has strong backing from large portions of the neuroscience community, a paper by Gauthier's team in 2016 argued that the lack of therapies and treatments for dementia has stagnated as a result of the Amyloid Hypothesis' near universal acceptance. Exploring the data from the UK Office of Health Economics, the team predicated that because the Amyloid Hypothesis was so widely accepted, researchers are less willing to explore other potential avenues out of fear of null hypotheses and other uncertain results. Gauthier's team's paper proposes that exploration into other avenues should be attempted.

## Research Question

As discussed in the literature review, most aspects of the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis and the impact of APP have either been exhausted as avenues of research, or are under investigation by government-backed laboratories. As a consequence, this paper is focused on identifying alternative genes which affect and/or contribute to Alzheimer's onset, as well as the manner in which these genes affect the onset of AD.
